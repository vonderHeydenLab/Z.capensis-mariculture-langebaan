# Dataset: *Ex situ* mariculture supports the restoration potential of the endangered seagrass *Zostera capensis*
## Dataset overview

Globally, seagrass meadows are experiencing ongoing declines and are increasingly targeted for restoration. Traditional *in situ* restoration techniques involve trade-offs between restoration success and impacts on donor meadows. To overcome these challenges, we present the first assessment of ex situ mariculture of the endangered seagrass *Zostera capensis* to support its restoration in South Africa. Seagrass cores with diameters of 5 cm and 10 cm, including their sediment, were harvested and cultivated in mariculture pools for 195 days. Changes in seagrass leaf length (cm) and shoot density (cm²) were monitored, and the effect of core size on these morphometrics was investigated. This dataset was collected to assess the potential of *ex situ* mariculture as a means to upscale seagrass restoration, as well as to evaluate the influence of core size on seagrass growth.

| **Variable**     | **Description**                                                                                                                                          |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Unit`           | Classification used to differentiate individual mariculture units which house boxes of sediment cores.                                                  |
| `Box`            | Identifier for each container used to house seagrass sediment cores (either 5 or 10 cm diameter ⌀).                                                     |
| `Core`           | Diameter of the seagrass sediment core (5 cm or 10 cm ⌀) from which datapoints were collected.                                                           |
| `Day`            | Experimental day count (from day 0 to day 195) representing the sampling timepoint.                                                                      |
| `Mean_length`    | Mean length of seagrass leaves measured from 3 longest leaves per core at each timepoint.                                                               |
| `Shoots`         | Number of shoots (vegetative biomass connecting leaves to rhizome) per sediment core recorded per sampling day.                                          |
| `Shoot_density`  | Number of seagrass shoots per cm² within each box, calculated for each sampling day.                                                                    |
